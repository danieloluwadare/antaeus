## Antaeus

Antaeus (/√¶nÀàtiÀê…ôs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia.
He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the
Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in
combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most "Software as a Service" (SaaS) companies, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database
contains a few invoices for the different markets in which we operate. Your task is to build the logic that will
schedule payment of those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some
decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions

Fork this repo with your solution. Ideally, we'd like to see your progression through commits, and don't forget to
update the README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just
really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as
small as you want.

## Developing

Requirements:

- \>= Java 11 environment

Open the project using your favorite text editor. If you are using IntelliJ, you can open the `build.gradle.kts` file
and it is gonna setup the project in the IDE for you.

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker
knowledge. We do recommend docker though.

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
docker build -t antaeus
docker run antaeus
```

### App Structure

The code given is structured as follows. Feel free however to modify the structure to fit your needs.

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ buildSrc
|  | gradle build scripts and project wide dependency declarations
|  ‚îî src/main/kotlin/utils.kt 
|      Dependencies
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-core
|       This is probably where you will introduce most of your new code.
|       Pay attention to the PaymentProvider and BillingService class.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database 
|       models, mappings and access layer.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the Internal and API models used throughout the
|       application.
|
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-rest
        Entry point for HTTP REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
```

## My Mantra

"Jeffrey Way always says Get it to green stage then keep refactoring it to make it better and better". This has been one
of my guiding principles for software development, it gives me the opportunity to get a working solution out and then
keep building my optimizations on top of that.

### Implementation Overview
I chose Quartz Scheduler to handle the processing of invoices as it is an open-source job scheduling library that can be integrated within virtually any Java/Kotlin application.

Quartz can be used to create simple or complex schedules for executing tens, hundreds, or even tens-of-thousands of jobs. Quartz offers job scheduling through patterns like cronjobs available in Unix systems. This is a great way of leveraging existing cronjob documentations as a quick guide.

## Design Pattern Implemented
- Chain of Responsibility (COR)
- State Design pattern
- Adapter 

# Algorithm For Processing Invoice


### InvoiceBatchServiceImpl Service
* This service implements the BatchService interface it helps to fetch the invoice in batches.
  * nextBatchExist() methods checks if the there is any available batch of invoice to be fetched. 
  * getNextBatch() This fetches the invoices with the limit passed into its constructor
  * setTotalNumberOfRecords(totalNumberOfRecords) This allows the calling method to set the totalNumber of records available


### Billing Service

* initiate() 
  * This method fetches the invoice in batches and invokes the BillingProcessorImpl to process each Batch

### BillingProcessorImpl Service

- This Service implement the BillingProcessor interface
- process(requestAdapter: RequestAdapter)
  - This Service Initializes the state machine
  - it populates the queue with the invoiceAdapter
  - keeps processing the invoice adapter until it terminates at the stop state is reached

## List of states
- All states class implements a common interface called ProcessorState
- states flow process
  - StartProcessorStateImpl
    - This state pull an invoice adapter from the queue 
    - set the invoice adapter as the current Invoice Process being processed
    - set the next state to VALIDATE_MAXIMUM_NUMBER_RETRIES_EXCEEDED_STATE
  - ValidateMaximumNumberRetriesExceededProcessorStateImpl
    - This state check if the current invoice has not exceeded the Maximum Retry Count 
    - set the next state to either MAXIMUM_NUMBER_RETRIES_EXCEEDED_STATE or MAXIMUM_NUMBER_RETRIES_NOT_EXCEEDED_STATE
  - MaximumNumberRetriesExceededProcessorStateImpl
    - Updates the status of the current invoice to failed 
    - invoke the AfterStateChangeService interface
    - set the next state QUERY_QUEUE_STATUS_STATE
  - MaximumNumberRetriesNotExceededProcessorStateImpl
    - set the next state INVOKE_PAYMENT_PROVIDER_STATE
  - InvokePaymentProviderProcessorStateImpl
    - Delay Invoking Payment provider call if Invoice has been processed before
    - Invoke Payment provider and save the response in the request
    - set the next state to either PAYMENT_SUCCESSFUL_STATE or PAYMENT_UNSUCCESSFUL_STATE or EXCEPTION_ENCOUNTERED_STATE
  - PaymentSuccessfulProcessorStateImpl
    - update status of the current invoice to paid
    - invoke the AfterStateChangeService interface
    - set the next state QUERY_QUEUE_STATUS_STATE
  - PaymentUnSuccessfulProcessorStateImpl
    - update status of the current invoice to failed
    - invoke the AfterStateChangeService interface
    - set the next state QUERY_QUEUE_STATUS_STATE
  - ExceptionEncounteredProcessorStateImpl
    - invoke the AfterStateChangeService interface(ExceptionEncounteredAfterStateChangeServiceImpl class which in turns calls the ExceptionHandler interface) 
    - set the next state QUERY_QUEUE_STATUS_STATE
  - QueryQueueStatusProcessorStateImpl
    - check if the queue is empty
    - set the next state to either START_STATE or STOP_STATE

### Assumptions
- Only one instance of the app will be used in billing the invoices, hence concurrency and related problems were not put
  into consideration.
